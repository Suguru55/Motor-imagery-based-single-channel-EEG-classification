# Motor imagery-based single-channel EEG classification
submitted to Global SIP 2018

__\<Despription\>__<br />

Matlab scripts in this repository determined the best combination that maximizes the classification accuracy of single-channel EEG-based motor imagery BCIs.<br />
SVM with power spectrum and MLP with single-channel CSP showed 86.6% classification accuracy for one subject in binary classification (mean: 63.5%).<br />  

For the assessment, we used an open-access dataset, <a href="http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#datasets" target="_blank">BCI competition IV dataset 2a</a>.<br />
